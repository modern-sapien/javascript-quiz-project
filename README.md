## JAVASCRIPT QUIZ GAME

## Introduction

This assignment was to create a Javascript Quiz Game that would populate a quiz on a static HTML page that you could navigate through and gain points by answer correctly and lose points by getting the wrong answer. I created an extra step to the process by giving bonus points to a user for finishing in a quicker amount of time based on time left as a score multiplier. Before I started this quiz I reviewed everything I could for three full days prior to beginning as this class is the first experience I've had with javascript.

## Approach
For this assignment I knew that I had the tools (after much review) to start in earnest using the tools I had available to me from practice on re-creating in class assignments and  outside research. I pseudo coded and created a strategy document to outline how I would approach creating this project before beginning.

Step 1. Creating a static HTML & CSS page with some elements I could hide & unhide depending on the status of the quiz being taken.

Step 2. Creating global variables that I could target and map quiz content onto easily and that I could apply values to later on in the project. 

Step 3. The quiz game itself relies on an array of objects that I access for content generation & a set of if/else statements on every button that correspond to when it will be a correct answer on a page.

Step 4. Creating a time that is responsive to wrong answers by losing time when an incorrect answer is selected.
