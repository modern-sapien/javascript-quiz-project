This is a document for strategizing how I will accomplish creating the Javascript Quiz Assignment


Page One - Create a landing page
   
    top nav bar
        top left - link to high scores
        top right timer countdown
    
    Div content holder 
        <h1> - Coding Quiz Challenge
        <h2> - "try and take this quiz blah blah."
        container 
        <div id = answer> "start quiz button in this instance
        <div id = answer> hidden
        <div id = answer> hidden
        <div id = answer> hidden
        container
        <div = line> hidden
        <h2>         hidden


    Timer already exists at the top right hand side, but hasn't been started
    
    Top left hand side is a high score link
    
    Content saying there is a quiz here
    
    a button to start

    div
    hidden line
    answer - content
